<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hello there! <br/>
  My name is Bethany Hunt. You can call me Beth. <br/>
  I am 29 years old. <br/>
  I am a web developer in the making! <br/>
  My passions aside from computers and technology include reading, music, crocheting, gaming! <br/>
  I've got 8 "kiddos":
  <ol>
    <li>Sophia, she is the oldest. She is part Lab and part Shepherd. She is a giant cuddle bug.</li>
    <li>LambChop, he is the newest addition. He is a Husky. He is a handful but a sweetie. </li>
    <li>Casper, he is my all black cat. He's my baby. He brings me all the love and luck.</li>
    <li>Bennie, he is a Siamese terror. We like to refer to him as "trash kitty" I'm sure you could guess why.</li>
    <li>Ginger, she is orange and white. She's "Miss Priss".</li>  
    <li>Evo, she is a calico cat. She doesn't take Bennie's bullying. She can stand her own ground.</li>
    <li>Lily, she is all orange. She's tiny with a big attitude.</li>
    <li>Last but not least we have Eros, he is a banana ball python. He is my noodle bug that could never hurt a fly. He's the most patient one of them all.</li>
  </ol> <br/>
  That's a little about me!
